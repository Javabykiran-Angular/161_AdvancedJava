1 Send Response of Html format
	
		PrintWriter pw= response.getWriter();
		response.setContentType("text/html");
		pw.print("<html><head><title>..</head><body>");
		pw.print("<h2> .... </h2>");
		pw.print("</body></html>");
		
	

2 Servlet collabration

- Call from one servlet to another servlet is called servlet collabration. We can add another HTML file (i.e. call from one servlet to another html file). To perform servlet collabration task we have to required an object of request Dispatcher. Request disppachter object we can obtained from HttpServletRequest 

3 Request Dispatcher

It is Interface 

- It has 2 methods 
	- forward(request,response)
	- include(request,response)
- In This case URL is not Change

Limitation of RD-
  -When we forward the request it does not get destroyed, while submitting some sensitive information it creates a problem of data redundancy (i.e. repetation) so we must avoid  use of request disppachter. To overcome this problem send redirect method comes into the pictures. This method is directly called using an object of HttpServletResponse
response.sendRedirect("url");  

4 Forward
5 include
6 Session Management 
	HttpSession session= request.getSession();
		session.setAttribute("name",stude.getfname());
		
		welcomeservlet
		HttpSession session= request.getSession();
			String username= (String) session.getAttribute("name");
